                Heathrow Airport? The transfer fare
                is cheaper than you might imagine.
                Heathrow taxis
                reliable than public transport, more often than not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each year, more than 70 million passengers pass through Heathrow
                Airport, making it the busiest international airport in the UK and
                the third busiest in the world, after Beijing and Atlanta.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are five main terminals at  Heathrow. Our transfer fares
                from Central London are starting from £60.00, regardless of
                which terminal you are departing from. Meanwhile, transfer from
                Heathrow Airport to Central London  (again, from any terminal)
                are charged at £65.00. All  Heathrow transfer prices are
                inclusive.

                <br /> One of the big worries when traveling with infants or small
                children is whether you’ll even be able to take a minicab to
                Heathrow Airport, without lugging along your own car
                seat. London Heathrow Taxi Ltd is one of the few minicab companies
                to offer complimentary, age-appropriate baby/child seats for your
                journey with us at no additional cost. To avail of this service, you
                will need to pre-book your Heathrow private car and advise of the
                age(s) of your child(ren).
